Orion: multivariate resource utilization time series evolution analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Orion implements algorithms described in the paper referenced below, designed for the analysis of 
resource utilization evolution. The files BUILD.txt and BUILD-Windows.txt provide information for 
building and installing the program on the Linux/OSX and Windows environments, respectively. 
Please see the included manual.pdf and Orion_ICDE15.pdf files in the manual directory for technical 
details. The manual also includes example commands for executing multivariate resource utilization 
time series evolution analysis with Orion.
