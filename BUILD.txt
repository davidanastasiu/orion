------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building Orion requires CMake 2.8, found at http://www.cmake.org/, as
well as GNU make. Assuming CMake and GNU make are installed, two
commands should suffice to build Orion:

     $ make config
     $ make

If <make> is successful, the program executable will be located in the 
build/<architecture>/src/ directory (e.g. build/Linux-x86_64/src/ for 64-bit
Linux). You may also invoke <make install> to automatically copy the file to
your chosen install location.


Configuration
-------------
Orion is primarily configured by passing options to make config. For
example:

     $ make config cc=gcc-4.2

would configure Orion to be built using GCC 4.2.

Common configuration options are:
  cc=[compiler]   - The C compiler to use [default is determined by CMake]
  prefix=[PATH]   - Set the installation prefix [/usr/local/ by default]

Advanced debugging related options:
  gdb=1       - Build with support for GDB [off by default]
  debug=1     - Enable debugging support [off by default]
  assert=1    - Enable asserts [off by default]
  assert2=1   - Enable very expensive asserts [off by default]

Orion's index and real data type size can be configured by editing
src/orion.h.


Installation
------------
To install Orion, run

    $ make install

The default installation prefix is /usr/local. To pick an installation 
prefix for Orion pass prefix=[path] to make config. For example,

    $ make config prefix=~/myroot/

will cause Orion to be installed in ~/myroot/ when make install is run.


Other make commands
-------------------
   $ make uninstall 
          Removes all files installed by 'make install'.
   
   $ make clean 
          Removes all object files but retains the configuration options.
   
   $ make distclean 
          Performs clean and completely removes the build directory.
